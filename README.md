# Bitcoin Donation Transparency

### About
The donation process for charities and nonprofits leaves something to be desired for donors. Once a donation is made, it seemingly disappears and joins a large mass of other funds held by the organizations. There isn't a direct way to discover exactly where their money went. Did my $10 a month actually provide 5 blankets to families in need? With this project, my hope is to determine whether a system using Bitcoin could provide the transparency necessary to unambiguously answer such a question.
