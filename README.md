# Bitcoin Donation Transparency

### Overview
With this project, my aim is to research and consider ways in which Bitcoin could be used to improve transparency in donations. The blockchain provides an unprecedented way to track public transactions and therefore could be used to match donations with more tangible expenses.

### About
The donation process for charities and nonprofits leaves something to be desired for donors. Once a donation is made, it seemingly disappears and joins a large mass of other funds held by the organizations. There isn't a direct way to discover exactly where their money went. Did my $10 a month actually provide 5 blankets to families in need? With this project, my hope is to determine whether a system using Bitcoin could provide the transparency necessary to unambiguously answer such a question.
